This addition to ngsolve allows to couple it with the boundary element library BEM++ ( www.bempp.org ).
It provides both a C++ interface to do so, as well as a python module.

Building:
To build this library, make sure you have compiled NGsolve with MPI support enabled.
This is requiread as recent versions of BEM++ link to MPI.
To build the module you can do the usual

mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make


sequence of commands. This will generate the c++ library as libngbem.so and the python module can be found in
build/python_package. Make sure the latter  directoriy is in your PYTHONPATH when attempting to use it.
